write_restart=0
read_restart=0
/
dt is the integration timestep
end time determines the duration of the simulation 
 ( the number of steps is (end_time - start_time)/ dt   the start time is given in the CONFIG file )
print_config is the interval to output the configuration
print_thermo is the interval to output the thermodynamic properties
write_restart determines the format of the output of the configuration
  0 : only positions
  1 : positions & velocities
  2 ! positions, velocities & forces
read_restart determines the format of the input of the configuration
  0 : only positions
  1 : positions & velocities
  2 ! positions, velocities & forces

&LJ_CONFIG
sigma0=2
epsilon0=50
/
sigma0 is the distance at which the potential is zero
epsilon0 is the maximum value of the depth of the potential

&BERENDSEN_CONFIG
T0=50
tau_temp=0.01
/
T0 is the targeted temperature
tau_temp is the time constant of the coupling external bath
